  <p>
    My name is Alexander Olivares, and I&#39;m on a journey to transform from a
    Leader in the supply chain industry to a passionate Software Engineer.
    I&#39;m currently attending a Full-Stack Developement Bootcamp through the
    University of Minnesota, and am set to graduate in October of 2023. I thrive
    on tackling new concepts head-on, delving into documentation, online
    courses, and hands-on projects to solidify my knowledge.
    <br /> The self-initiated education showcases my determination,
    adaptability, and drive to excel in a new field. Through this learning
    journey, I&#39;ve honed my problem-solving skills and gained a profound
    appreciation for the iterative nature of software development. This mindset
    has not only fueled my ability to swiftly grasp new concepts but also
    motivated me to continuously seek opportunities to expand my skills and
    contribute positively to the tech community.
